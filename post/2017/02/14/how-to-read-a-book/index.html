<p><strong>&lsquo;How to Read a Book&rsquo;</strong> by Mortimer J. Adler and Charles Van Doren, originally published in 1940, has become
a rare phenomenon, a <em>living</em> classic. It is the best and most successful guide to reading comprehension for
the general reader.</p>

<p>Two goals of reading:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reading for information;</li>
<li>Reading for understanding;</li>
</ul>

<p>The levels of reading:</p>

<ul>
<li>Elementary reading;</li>
<li>Inspectional reading:</li>
<li>Analytical reading;</li>
<li>Syntopical reading;</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Look at the title page and, if the book has one, at the preface.</li>
<li>Study the table of contents.</li>
<li>Check the index.</li>
<li>Read the publisher blurb.</li>
<li>Look now at the chapters that seem to be pivotal to its argument.</li>

</ol>

<h2 id="inspectional-reading-ii-superficial-reading">Inspectional Reading II: Superficial Reading</h2>

<p>In tackling a difficult book for the first time, read it through without ever stopping to look up or ponder
the things you do not understand right away.</p>

<h2 id="the-essense-of-active-reading-the-four-basic-questions-a-reader-asks">The Essense of Active Reading: The Four Basic Questions a Reader Asks</h2>

<ol>
<li>What is the book about as a whole?</li>
<li>What is being said in detail, and how?</li>
<li>Is the book true, in whole or part?</li>
<li>What of it? Why does the author think it is important to know these things?</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-first-stage-of-analytical-reading-rules-for-finding-what-a-book-is-about">The First Stage of Analytical Reading: Rules For Finding What a Book Is About</h2>

<ol>
<li>Classify the book according to kind and subject matter.</li>
<li>State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity.</li>
<li>Enumerate its major parts in their order and relations, and outline these parts as you have outlined the whole.</li>
<li>Define the problem or problems the author is trying to solve.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-second-stage-of-analytical-reading-rules-for-interpreting-a-book-s-contents">The Second Stage of Analytical Reading: Rules For Interpreting a Book&rsquo;s Contents</h2>

<ol>
<li>Come to terms with the author by interpreting his key words.</li>
<li>Grasp the author&rsquo;s leading propositions by dealing with his most important sentences.</li>
<li>Know the author&rsquo;s arguments, by finding them in, or constructing them out of, sequence of sentences.</li>
<li>Determine which of his problems the author has solved, and which he has not; and of the latter, decide
which the author knew he had failed to solve.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-third-stage-of-analytical-reading-rules-for-criticizing-a-book-as-communication-of-knowledge">The Third Stage of Analytical Reading: Rules For Criticizing a Book as Communication of Knowledge</h2>

<h3 id="general-maxims-of-intellectual-etiquette">General Maxims of Intellectual Etiquette</h3>

<ol>
<li>Do not begin criticism until you have completed your outline and your interpretation of the book.</li>
<li>Do not disagree disputatiously or contentiously.</li>
<li>Demonstrate that you recognize the difference between knowledge and more personal opinion by presenting
good reasons for any critical judgment you make.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="special-criteria-for-points-of-criticism">Special Criteria for Points of Criticism</h3>

<ol>
<li>Show written the author is uninformed.</li>
<li>Show wherein the author is misinformed.</li>
<li>Show wherein the author is illogical.</li>
<li>Show wherein the author&rsquo;s analysis or account is incomplete.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="syntopical-reading">Syntopical Reading</h2>

<h3 id="stage-i-surveying-the-field-preparatory-to-syntopical-reading">Stage I: Surveying the Field Preparatory to Syntopical Reading</h3>

<ol>
<li>Create a tentative bibliography of your subject by recourse to library catalogues, advisors, and bibliographies in books.</li>
<li>Inspect <em>all</em> of the books on the tentative bibliography to ascertain which are germane to your subject, and also to acquire
a clearer idea of the subject.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="stage-ii-syntopical-reading-of-the-bibliography-amassed-in-stage-i">Stage II: Syntopical Reading of the Bibliography Amassed in Stage I</h3>

<ol>
<li>Inspect the books already identified as relevant to your subject in Stage I in order to find the most relevant passages.</li>
<li>Bring the authors to terms by constructing a neutral terminology of the subject that all, or the great majority, of the
authors can be interpreted as employing, whether they actually employ the words or not.</li>
<li>Establish a set of neutral propositions for all of the authors by framing a set of questions to which all or most of the
authors can be interpreted as giving answers, whether they actually treat the questions explicitly or not.</li>
<li>Define the issues, both major and minor ones, by ranging the opposing answers of authors to the various questions on one
side of an issue or another. You should remember that an issue does not always exist explicitly between or among authors,
but that it sometimes has to be constructed by interpretation of the author&rsquo;s views on matters that may not have been
their primary concern.</li>
<li>Analyze the discussion by ordering the questions and issues in such way as to throw maximum light on the subject. More
general issues should precede less general ones, and relations among issues should be clearly indicated.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note: Dialectical detachment or objectivity should, ideally, be maintained throughout. One way to insure this is always
to accompany an interpretation of an author&rsquo;s views on an issue with an actual quotation from his text.</p>
